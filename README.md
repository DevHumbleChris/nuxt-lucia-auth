# Nuxt.js Lucia Auth Starter Template

## Motivation

Implementing authentication in Nuxt.js, especially Email+Password authentication, can be challenging. NuxtAuth [sidebase.io](https://auth.sidebase.io/) intentionally limits email password functionality to discourage the use of passwords due to security risks and added complexity. However, in certain projects, clients may require user password authentication. Lucia offers a flexible alternative to NuxtAuth and other Nuxt auth utils, providing more customization options without compromising on security. This template serves as a starting point for building a Nuxt.js app with Lucia authentication.

## Lucia vs. NuxtAuth

Lucia is less opinionated than NuxtAuth [sidebase.io](https://auth.sidebase.io/), offering greater flexibility for customization. While Lucia involves more setup, it provides a higher degree of flexibility, making it a suitable choice for projects requiring unique authentication configurations.

## Key Features

- **Authentication:** üíº Support for Credential and OAuth authentication.
- **Authorization:** üîí Easily manage public and protected routes within the project.
- **Email Verification:** üìß Verify user identities through email.
- **Password Reset:** üîë Streamline password resets by sending email password reset links.
- **Lucia + Nuxt Server Routes:** üîÑ Similar to NuxtAuth, granting access to sessions and user information through server routes.
- **Email template:** ‚úâÔ∏è Craft your email templates using and send email them with [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/).
- **PostgreSQL Database:** üõ¢Ô∏è Utilize a PostgreSQL database set up using Drizzle for enhanced performance and type safety.
- **Database Migration:** üöÄ Included migration script to extend the database schema according to your project needs.
